# Multi-Class-Prediction-of-Cirrhosis-Outcomes

We will try to predict the probability of a patient's death, censored or censored due to liver transplantation. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `Multi-Class Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes.ipynb`, which provides a predictive analysis, model construction, and selection. The notebook aims to help you understand and predict a patient's death, censored and censored due to liver transplantation, using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

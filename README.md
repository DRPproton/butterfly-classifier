# Multi-Class Butterfly Classifier

This Butterfly Classifier API was created for my daughter, who loves these colorful insects. I would like to use the API on a web or mobile app. This API uses advanced image recognition technology to classify various species of butterflies from web images. The aim is to provide a simple, effective tool for butterfly enthusiasts (my daughter), researchers, and app developers who wish to integrate this functionality into web or mobile applications

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `Multi-Class Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes.ipynb`, 
which provides a predictive analysis, model construction, and selection. 
The notebook aims to help you understand and predict a patient's death, censored and censored due to liver transplantation, 
using data analysis and machine learning techniques.
